This was built before Decap was released, running on Netlify CMS is deprecated. 

Website built from starting files used by [Kevin Powell](https://kevinpowell.co) 
You can [watch this video](https://youtu.be/4wD00RT6d-g) to see how Kevin uses Eleventy, Netlify, and Netlify CMS to create a full-featured blog site built entirely with static files.

This build incorporates 11ty image plugin (https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/) for image optimization. 

If someone stumbles across this I at least hope you liked draw mode :)

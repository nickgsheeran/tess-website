    Established in 2013, Marz is a Chicago-based brewery founded by a collective
    of artists and beer nerds. They roll out an average of 10 bizarrely unique,
    yet highly delicious, small batch brews per month. 

    In 2021, Marz expanded into the world of spirits, releasing bottles of bourbon, vodka, and gin, each featuring custom illustrations that cleverly complement the pun-inspired names. Bourbon of the Future imagines a futuristic world centered around corn, bourbon's key ingredient. Fellowship of the Gin takes a more abstract approach, incorporating a symmetrical airbrushed pattern. Lastly, Society of the Vodka, created in collaboration with Nat Thomas, draws on imagery of secret societies to craft intricate, layered designs.

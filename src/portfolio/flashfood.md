    Flashfood is an app that bridges the gap between grocers and consumers,
    offering a platform to discover and purchase grocery items nearing their
    best-before dates at discounted prices. 


    My assignment was to develop a food-based illustration system to compliment the rest of the brand. The final illustrations were meticulously designed to evoke a sense of bountiful freshness, enticing users to explore the offerings available on the platform.

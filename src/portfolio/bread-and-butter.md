    Bread and Butter is a Brooklyn bakery started by Autumn Moultrie and Brian
    Villanaeua of Back Alley Bread. They are known for their angel doughnuts,
    savory pastries, Jamaican beef patties, and other comfort foods inspired by
    their childhood and communities. The final branding has yet to be released,
    but this was an initial direction that I worked on for the bakery. 


    The main component of the brand is the type system which uses two typefaces, one (GT America) a simple grotesque sans that feels professional and buttoned up nodding to Autumn and Brianâ€™s experience in fine dining, and Blitz, a script font that evokes a sense of playfulness and nostalgia nodding to the whimsical and comforting nature of their baked goods. The system is finalized with illustrations to nod to their impeccable perfectionism and sense of craft.

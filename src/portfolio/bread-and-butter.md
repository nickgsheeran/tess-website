  - Bread and Butter is a Brooklyn bakery founded by Autumn Moultrie and Brian
    Villanueva of Back Alley Bread. Renowned for their angel doughnuts, savory
    pastries, Jamaican beef patties, and other comfort foods rooted in their
    childhoods and communities, the bakery has quickly gained attention. While
    the final branding is still in progress, this was one of the initial
    concepts I developed for them.
  - "The core of the brand is its type system, featuring two distinct typefaces:
    GT America, a clean, professional grotesque sans that reflects Autumn and
    Brianâ€™s fine dining background, and Blitz, a playful script font that adds a
    touch of nostalgia, echoing the warmth and whimsy of their baked goods. The
    system is rounded out with illustrations that highlight their meticulous
    craftsmanship and dedication to perfection."

    Framework is a new brick and mortar wellness space focused on the health
    benefits of contrast therapy, a practice that involves alternating between
    hot and cold temperatures. Inspired by his own journey of rejuvenation after
    a fast-paced career in tech, Framework's founder aimed to create a brand
    that transcends fitness trends, elevating the simple practice of traditional
    Nordic sauna and cold plunge from one-off treatments into a routine
    practice.


    Highlighting the radical simplicity of contrast therapy's fundamental elements—hot air and cold water—to visualize the brand, we employed immersive, temperature-inspired gradients that bring the experience to life. The brand strikes a balance between approachability and intellect, creating an inviting environment that communicates the science behind sauna in a simple and straightforward way.

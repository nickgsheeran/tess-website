  - In 2021, Franklyn was engaged to create a cohesive brand identity for World
    Parkinson’s Day, uniting a global network of organizations across 80
    countries in their mission to raise awareness and combat Parkinson’s
    disease. The designs on this page reflect one of the initial concepts I
    developed for the brand, with the final result showcased on the World
    Parkinson’s Day website.

    Knowing that this brand system would be handled by countless individuals
    across various nonprofits, we aimed to build a foolproof design that could
    hold up no matter who used it. To ensure accessibility and consistency, this
    direction featured universal default fonts and colors based on standard
    palettes from software like Adobe Illustrator. Balancing these practical
    choices, we designed a logo and illustration style that merged clean,
    precise geometry with raw, organic edges for a distinctive and approachable
    look.

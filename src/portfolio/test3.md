    In 2021, Franklyn was engaged to  create a unified brand identity for World
    Parkinson’s Day, a global alliance of organizations from 80 countries
    seeking to raise awareness and fight Parkinson’s disease. These designs
    represent one of the original concepts I developed for the brand. The final
    direction can be explored on the World Parkinson’s Day website.


    Mindful that this brand would be utilized by hundreds of individuals across several nonprofit organizations, our goal was to create an infallible system that would maintain its integrity regardless of who handled it. For this reason, we opted for default fonts that are universally accessible and colors derived from the standard palette found in software such as Adobe Illustrator. To complement these more rudimentary elements, we crafted a logo and illustration style that juxtaposes perfect geometry with raw edges.

  - Already a direct-to-consumer hit in the bedding world, Brooklinen set out to
    reach even more customers by launching “The Marlow Pillow.”
  - The visual identity we created for Marlow centers their belief that there
    are many different types of sleepers, and Marlow's pillow works the best for
    most. A simple yet expressive illustration style allows the brand to
    showcase a diversity of sleeping styles and, when appropriate, ventures into
    whimsy. With a wordmark and color palette that carefully balances modernity
    and nostalgia, the brand strives to be appealing to anyone in search of good
    sleep, whether young or old.

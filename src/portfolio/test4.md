    Already a direct-to-consumer success story in bedding, Brooklinen saw an
    opportunity to expand further through creating “The Marlow Pillow.”


    The visual identity we created for Marlow centers their belief that there are many different types of sleepers, and Marlow's pillow works the best for most. A simple yet expressive illustration style allows the brand to showcase a diversity of sleeping styles and, when appropriate, ventures into whimsy. With a wordmark and color palette that carefully balances modernity and nostalgia, the brand strives to be appealing to anyone in search of good sleep, whether young or old.

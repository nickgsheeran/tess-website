    Materiél magazine is a periodical published every few years, that features
    artists, illustrators, and designers commissioned to craft original work
    around a unifying theme. In the 2021 edition, the theme was “aaaaaah,” which
    could be interpreted as a sigh of relaxation or a scream of fright. 

    For my contribution, I encapsulated both states of being in a single illustration—a tumultuous composition arranged in a harmonious and symmetrical manner. Because of the dual nature of this illustration, it was also adapted to the front and back covers of the magazine.

    traffic cones, and animals, all scattered and flying chaotically through the
    air.

    The artwork shows a chaotic scene of various objects breaking and flying
    through the air, yet arranged in a visually balanced, symmetrical way.

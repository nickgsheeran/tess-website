  - Over the course of a decade, WeWork became the undisputed leader in
    coworking. After its controversial founder’s exit, WeWork was left with an
    identity crisis. They needed to simultaneously shake off past narratives as
    well as navigate a new office landscape shaped by the pandemic.  At
    Franklyn, I helped WeWork reimagine their brand strategy and visual identity
    to cement their position as industry leaders.
  - Quickly, we realized that WeWork was in the unique position to answer
    questions of where, how, and even why we work. Recognizing that
    decision-making power in the workplace is moving back to the individual, we
    wanted to shift the conversation from “we” to “you”. With this idea in mind,
    we visualized WeWork as a platform for its members through a layered system
    of symbols and illustrations. The geometric shapes symbolize “We” — the
    buildings, hands, plates, furniture, and other objects that form the
    foundation of a WeWork. The illustrations symbolize “You” — the individuals
    who take those objects and make them their own to create and innovate. At
    Franklyn, I came up with this original concept, crafted the illustration
    style, and executed many of the final designs.

    There is an open notebook with the branded wework illustrations sketched
    into it, and a ruler on top. There is a hand in the bottom right of the
    image holding a WeWork card. There is another hand in the top left of the
    image writing something on a piece of paper. There is a laptop in the top of
    the image. All of these objects showcase different elements of the new
    WeWork brand.

title: WeWork
description: >-
  Over the course of a decade, WeWork became the undisputed leader in coworking.
  After its controversial founder’s exit, WeWork was left with an identity
  crisis. They needed to simultaneously shake off past narratives as well as
  navigate a new office landscape shaped by the pandemic.  At Franklyn, I helped
  WeWork reimagine their brand strategy and visual identity to cement their
  position as industry leaders.<br>


  Quickly, we realized that WeWork was in the unique position to answer questions of where, how, and even why we work. Recognizing that decision-making power in the workplace is moving back to the individual, we wanted to shift the conversation from “we” to “you”. With this idea in mind, we visualized WeWork as a platform for its members through a layered system of symbols and illustrations. The geometric shapes symbolize “We” — the buildings, hands, plates, furniture, and other objects that form the foundation of a WeWork. The illustrations symbolize “You” — the individuals who take those objects and make them their own to create and innovate. At Franklyn, I came up with this original concept, crafted the illustration style, and executed many of the final designs.

    There is an open notebook with the branded wework illustrations sketched
    into it, and a ruler on top. There is a hand in the bottom right of the
    image holding a WeWork card. There is another hand in the top left of the
    image writing something on a piece of paper. There is a laptop in the top of
    the image. All of these objects showcase different elements of the new
    WeWork brand.

description: Over the course of a decade, WeWork became the undisputed leader in
  coworking. Founded in New York City’s startup culture, they rapidly expanded
  to hundreds of locations around the globe with the goal of providing flexible
  office space and changing the world while they were at it. After its
  controversial founder’s exit, WeWork was left with an identity crisis. They
  needed to simultaneously shake off the narrative of the past as well as
  navigate the new office landscape shaped by the pandemic. With a company full
  of folks still striving to make the workplace a better place, Franklyn helped
  WeWork reimagine their brand strategy and visual identity to cement their
  position as industry leaders.

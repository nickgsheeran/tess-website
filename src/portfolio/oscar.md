  - "Since 2014, Oscar has been a trailblazer in modern healthcare, known for
    its playful, user-first branding. In 2020, I was brought on to create a
    fresh illustration style that evolved beyond their previous whimsical look.
    This new direction aimed to spotlight what sets Oscar apart: its warmth and
    sincerity. The illustrations took on a more realistic tone, mirroring the
    true makeup of Oscarâ€™s diverse audience and celebrating their genuine
    experiences. The focus shifted from caricatures to relatable, imperfect
    glimpses of real life, embracing the messiness and authenticity that
    resonate with people. Paired with the updated brand, these illustrations
    convey warmth, sincerity, and the genuine human touch that defines Oscar."

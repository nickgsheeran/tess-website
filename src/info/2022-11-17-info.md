Tess is a freelance designer, illustrator, and hypochondriac. She grew up in Seattle, Washington but has since lived in Baltimore (where she went to Maryland Institute College of Art) and New York (where she worked at Franklyn). In 2023 she moved to Amsterdam to pursue her lifelong goal of casually eating gouda by a canal for lunch. Feel free to say hi at tesshavas@gmail.com if youâ€™d like to join her for lunch or collaborate on a project.
